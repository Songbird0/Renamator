A basic tool written to rename my emails (and maybe yours!).


## Problem

As a Proton customer, when it's time to export my emails, my dumped file 
names look like this:

```5___mr8PBQsSHYfghchbfE-0cxdpxxKuwZZeySgiswDXKubFhLznCyONFNePfAXsVgymzLPdJM7rqUPxowF_3qsA==.eml```

Ahem... that's not pretty nice to search through this mess.

## Solution (!)

... Renamator, of course! I give them a root directory and it renames my emails 
by their respective subject. Well... it's currently buggy when it comes to 
deal with identical file names but fear not! I'll put them some additionnal 
neurones really soon!
